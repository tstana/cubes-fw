/*
 * msp_exp_handler.h
 * Author: John Wikman
 * 
 * Provides prototypes for all functions that an experiment will use to
 * interface against MSP.
 *
 * For intuitive reasons, expsend is used instead of obcreq and exprecv is
 * used instead of obcsend.
 *
 * These functions will always be called in a certain order. For example like
 * this:
 *   1. msp_exprecv_start()
 *   2. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   3. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   4. msp_exprecv_complete()
 *   5. msp_exprecv_start()
 *   6. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   7. msp_exprecv_complete()
 *   8. msp_expsend_start()
 *   9. msp_expsend_data()
 *  10. msp_expsend_complete()
 *
 * Or like this (in case of errors):
 *   1. msp_exprecv_start()
 *   2. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   3. msp_exprecv_error()
 *   4. msp_exprecv_start()
 *   5. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   6. msp_exprecv_data()
 *   7. msp_exprecv_complete()
 *   8. msp_exprecv_syscommand()
 *   9. msp_exprecv_syscommand()
 *  10. msp_exprecv_start()
 *  11. msp_exprecv_data()
 *  12. msp_exprecv_complete()
 *
 * In short, each function with the "_start" suffix is called at the start of
 * every transaction to allow for preparation of data and buffers. Each
 * function with the "_complete" suffix is called at the end of every
 * successful transaction. If an error occured during a transaction, the
 * corresponding function with the "_error" suffix is called instead of the
 * function with the "_complete" suffix. The main exception is when a system
 * command is received from the OBC, then msp_exprecv_syscommand is the only
 * function that is called.
